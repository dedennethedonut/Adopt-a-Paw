        <h1>Adopt a Paw</h1>
        <p> When people think of adopting a pet, they think of getting one from a local pet store, not a shelter. Each year, 2.7 million adoptable dogs and cats are euthanized in the United States, simply because too many pets come into shelters and too few people consider adoption when looking for a pet. Here are many reasons to adopt a pet from a shelter:
</p>
        
        <p>1) The number of euthanized animals could be reduced dramatically</p>

        <p>2) It will cost you less</p>

        <p>3) Shelter animals tend to be healthier than those bread for profit</p>

        <p>4) Adopting makes the marketplace less available to puppy mills</p>
